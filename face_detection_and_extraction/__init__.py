"""This module contains the files needed for character face detection and extraction
using the model developed by https://github.com/barisbatuhan/DASS_Det_Inference/tree/main

Since the authors did not release the model as a pypi package, I cloned the repo
separately and used these files to run face detection and extraction. For the model
weights, refer to https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sQX36bWeIGoAGlQUiaUA9wnEUwtVsS76

For setting up the repo, refer to the GitHub repository of the model, also linked above.
